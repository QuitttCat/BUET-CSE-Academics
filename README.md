Thank you for providing the specific link for CSE-220-Signals-and-Linear-Systems!

Since I don't have the links for the other two repositories (CSE-200 and CSE-214), I will use your known GitHub username (QuitttCat) to hypothesize the likely URLs for the other repos, as they usually follow the same naming convention.

If the assumed links below are incorrect, please provide the actual links, and I will update them immediately.
